### Hi there 👋, Andreea Popa
#### Software tester
My name is Andreea Popa. I graduated in Law from the Valahia University and I worked in a Law office. I also tried other areas, but I discovered a special interest in Software Testing. My main goal is to continuously improve my testing knowledge and skills to achieve high-quality results. Therefore, I would like to share my projects based on specific tools and methods learned in courses, personal studies and researches.

Skills: Python/ Selenium WebDriver/ HTML / CSS / SQL
